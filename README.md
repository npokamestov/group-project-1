THEN I am presented with a list of job listings from multiple platforms displaying the job title and location
WHEN I click on a listing
THEN the listing is added to the search history list for retrieval later
THEN the listing opens in a new tab using the corresponding platform
WHEN I click on the job listing title in the search history
THEN I am again presented with the listing opened in a new tab
